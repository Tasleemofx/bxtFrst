            I’m Tesleem Oladepo, a passionate Software Engineer and Frontend Developer currently seeking roles in frontend development. I have a strong interest in web engineering, JavaScript, and Ecommerce1. I’m currently honing my skills in JavaScript, Reactjs, and Nodejs1.

            I love sharing knowledge and am a firm believer in the power of documentation. I’ve been creating frontend designs and mockups using React.js, HTML, CSS, plain JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, SQL (PostgreSQL), RestFul APIs, and Typescript1. You can check out some of my work on my GitHub1.

            As a frontend developer, I take pleasure in crafting digital entities that inhabit the internet, be it websites, applications,
            or anything in between. My main experience as a frontend developer is working remotely with a startup based in the UK.
            This experience has enriched my knowledge and skills across diverse fields, making each project a valuable learning opportunity.
